# About GDES-IPE

The Jean Monnet Module Project titled "Global Dynamics of Energy Security: An IPE Perspective on Sustainable Supply Chains in Europe," referred to as GDES-IPE, aims to explore the intricate relationship between energy security, international political economy (IPE), and sustainable supply chains in the European context. The project's rationale is rooted in the evolving global energy landscape, where traditional power structures are shifting, and sustainable energy sources are becoming increasingly critical.

As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and seeks to transition towards more sustainable energy practices, understanding the IPE dynamics governing energy security is paramount. GDES-IPE addresses the gap in existing literature by delving into the complexities of sustainable energy supply chains within the broader context of IPE. The project recognizes the transition from conventional energy paradigms to sustainable alternatives and acknowledges the importance of comprehensive education and analysis in navigating this transformative period.

The primary objectives of GDES-IPE are threefold: i) to provide a comprehensive teaching programme on the interplay between energy security, IPE, and sustainable supply chains in Europe, ii) to conduct comparative studies on inter-regional and trans-regional relations within the energy sector, and iii) to disseminate this knowledge to a diverse audience, including graduate and undergraduate students, academic and teaching personnel, policymakers, as well as external entities such as universities and think tanks.

The target audience for GDES-IPE encompasses students at various academic levels, academic and teaching staff in higher education institutions, and policymakers involved in shaping energy policies. Beyond academia, GDES-IPE aims to actively engage with a broader society by extending its outreach to entities interested in sustainable energy practices. Through this module project, GDES-IPE seeks to bridge the gap between theory and practice, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics surrounding global energy security and sustainable supply chains. 

It aims to achieve the following:

-   Disseminate cutting-edge research.
-   Create educational opportunities.
-   Foster partnerships within and beyond Europe.
